This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(table1)
df<-read.csv('fake_users.csv')
df$sex<-factor(df$sex, labels = c("Male","Female"))
df$Country<-factor(df$Country)
df$Cities<-factor(df$Cities)
df$Education<-factor(df$Education)
df$SNP1<-factor(df$SNP1)
df$SNP2<-factor(df$SNP2)
df$SNP3<-factor(df$SNP3)
df$SNP4<-factor(df$SNP4)
df$SNP5<-factor(df$SNP5)

table1(~ Age + sex + Country + Cities + Height + Education + BMI + gene1 + gene2 + gene3 + gene4 + gene5 + gene6 + gene7 + gene8 + gene9 + gene10 + SNP1 + SNP2 + SNP3+ SNP4 + SNP5  | factor(Cases), data=df)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
